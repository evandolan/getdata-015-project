# getdata-015-project
This repository contains my submission for the course project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data"
course on Coursera.org. This file describes the files in my submission.

- 'run_analysis.R': The R script is called that contains the R code I wrote to complete the tasks in this assignment.

- 'CodeBook.md': Describes the variables, the data, and the transformations used in the run_analysis.R file.

There is only one R script in this repository and it contains all of my work. The code is very 
straight forward. Each line of code can run in the order they appear in the file. There are a 
number of functions in the file. The code used to create the functions are always above any 
code that calls the functions.


The tidydata.txt submitted along with this project is not complete. I was able to create a tidy dataset
based on only one subject at a time. As a sample, I provided the values for subject 1. My code can produce
the tidy data for any one subject, but not all at once.
